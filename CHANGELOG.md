# Changelog

All notable changes to VisualWeaver are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.13.1] — 2026-09-05

### Added
- **`geometry` draws smooth curves.** New element types `bezier`/`curve` (a cubic
  Bézier through its control points) and `spline` (a curve passing through every
  point), for light paths, trajectories and freehand shapes.
- **`scene` cards have controls under the canvas.** **Rotate**, **Tilt** and
  **Zoom** sliders show the current view and drive it — with the keyboard, a
  finger, or for a precise angle — and follow a mouse orbit so the two never
  disagree; **↻ Spin** turns the scene continuously until you touch it.

### Fixed
- A 3-D `scene` could not be rotated, zoomed or panned: the "3-D view paused"
  overlay meant for a lost WebGL context was painted over every live scene and
  took each drag and wheel. It now appears only when the context is actually
  lost.
- A `geometry` text label is drawn exactly as written: `R_s` and `x^2` stay `R_s`
  and `x^2` instead of rendering as the literal strings `R<sub>s</sub>` and
  `x<sup>2</sup>`.
- A `geometry` stroke set the SVG way — `"dashArray": "5,5"` — is now dashed
  instead of drawn solid.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added
- **`scene` — 3-D scenes.** A new fence draws a small scene of primitives (box,
  sphere, cylinder, cone, torus, plane and the regular polyhedra): drag to rotate,
  wheel to zoom, shift-drag to pan, **⟲ Reset view** to return to the starting
  camera and **⬇ PNG** to save the current view.
- **`plotly` — statistical charts.** Histograms, box and violin plots, heatmaps,
  contours, sankey, treemap, sunburst, candlestick, waterfall and funnel charts
  from Plotly figure JSON.
- **`ode` — phase portraits.** A 2-D system (`dx = …`, `dy = …`) is drawn as its
  direction field with trajectories integrated forward and backward from each
  `start:` point; `param:` sliders re-integrate the portrait as you drag, as in
  `plot`.
- **`sequence` and `phylo`.** FASTA sequences — nucleotide or protein, coloured
  and numbered; several records are shown as an alignment with the differing
  columns marked — and Newick phylogenetic trees, drawn as a phylogram with a
  scale bar when branch lengths are given and as a cladogram otherwise.
- **`reaction` — reaction schemes.** Reaction SMILES (`reactants>agents>products`)
  drawn as structures with plus signs and a labelled arrow.
- **`circuit` — electrical schematics.** A JSON netlist on a grid (resistor,
  capacitor, inductor, battery, AC and DC sources, diode, LED, switch, lamp, fuse,
  meters, ground and wires) drawn as a schematic with junction dots and labels.
- **`plot` — more curve forms.** Parametric curves (`x = f(t)`, `y = g(t)`,
  `t = a .. b`), polar curves (`r = f(theta)`), vector fields (`field: fx, fy`),
  contour plots (`contour: f(x, y)`) and implicit curves
  (`implicit: f(x, y) = g(x, y)`), with an optional `y = a .. b` window; a curve
  with no domain is framed to fit, and a formula that uses an undeclared symbol
  says which one.
- **`mermaid` — more diagram types.** Mindmaps, quadrant charts, XY charts,
  sankey, block and kanban diagrams.
- **A saved base instruction that predates new visual blocks still gets them.**
  A base instruction saved before a block existed no longer hides it: the missing
  blocks' instructions are added to each turn automatically, so the model draws a
  circuit as a `circuit`, a scene as a `scene`, and so on, even when the saved copy
  never mentioned them. Settings → Templates notes this and offers **↺ Reset to
  shipped default** to fold them in permanently.

### Fixed
- A `geometry` text element positioned as a nested pair, `[[x, y], "…"]`, is
  drawn instead of being skipped with a JSXGraph parent-type error.
- The embedding model and the reranker load from the local model cache without
  contacting Hugging Face when they are already on disk, and a request that
  needs the model while it is still loading waits for that load instead of
  starting a second one. After a restart with no route to huggingface.co, the
  first page load no longer waits minutes for the Hub's retries.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Fractals are interactive.** On a Mandelbrot or Julia card, drag a box to zoom
  into it — the selection is kept to the card's proportions, so the zoom never
  distorts — while a plain click still zooms in and shift-click zooms out. Every
  fractal now has a slider under the canvas that re-renders it in place: **Iterations**
  for Mandelbrot and Julia, **Depth** for the L-system curves, **Iterations** for the
  Barnsley fern and other chaos-game figures, and **Steps** for the strange attractors.
- **The Sierpinski triangle and carpet are drawn as nested outlines with a Depth
  slider.** Each level divides the figure into smaller copies of itself — the gasket
  as nested triangles, the carpet as nested squares — the way the Koch snowflake's
  depth works, rather than a fixed point count.
- **New ` ```fractal ` preset `frond`.** A fern drawn as an L-system — a stem segment
  is replaced by a branching frond, recursively, with a **Depth** slider — alongside
  the classic Barnsley `fern`, which stays the IFS point cloud.
- **Every figure's Source pane is editable.** Opening **Source** on a ` ```plot `,
  ` ```abc `, ` ```svg ` or ` ```latex ` card now offers the same **▶ Apply** and
  **↺ Reset** as the other rendered blocks: change the markup or spec and the card
  re-renders in place, without a round trip to the model. A re-applied `plot`
  rebuilds its sliders and definition list, and a re-applied score is what
  **▶ Play** plays. Edits stay local to the page; the stored message is unchanged.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Fourteen more fractal presets.** `hilbert`, `peano` and `moore` (space-filling
  curves), `gosper`, `levy`, `arrowhead` and `tree` (self-similar curves), `carpet`
  (Sierpiński carpet), and six strange attractors — `lorenz`, `rossler`, `thomas`,
  `halvorsen`, `clifford` and `dejong`. Naming one is enough: `{"type":"hilbert",
  "order":5}` draws a fifth-order Hilbert curve.
- **Strange attractors are a new kind of ` ```fractal `.** Continuous systems are
  integrated and drawn as an orbit graded along the trajectory; a three-dimensional
  one takes `plane` to choose its projection, and each takes its own named
  coefficients.
- **Alternate spellings of a preset resolve to it.** `Hilbert Curve`, `flowsnake`,
  `Koch snowflake` and `lorenz_attractor` all name presets, and `order` and `steps`
  work as well as `depth` and `iter`.

### Fixed
- **A table's computed total now looks like the column it sums.** A column of
  `$3,400.75` totalled to `5791.35` — the right number, formatted as a different
  kind of thing. The total takes the column's own prefix, suffix, grouping and
  decimals.
- **Table columns sort and total by value in more notations.** Every kind of
  table — the ` ```table ` block and any Markdown table in an answer — now reads
  `99,25 EUR`, `1.234,50`, `(50.25)`, `12 345` and `12,34,567` as the numbers
  they are, and leaves version strings and dotted dates to sort as versions and
  dates rather than misreading them as decimals. Previously the two kinds of table used different parsers, and both
  were wrong in places: `99,25 EUR` came out as 9925, and accounting
  parentheses and space-grouped numbers sorted as text.
- **A hand-edited `config.json` no longer takes the app down.** A value of the
  wrong type in `cache`, `embedding`, `redis_endpoints` or `base_instruction`
  made the config request fail, which left the settings screen unable to load,
  and a wrong type in `base_instruction` also stopped every answer —
  and a save from that state could overwrite web sources, watch folders and
  stored API keys. Saving is now refused until the configuration has been read.
- **A saved Base Instruction that predates the app is now flagged.** Saving
  Settings once replaced the shipped instruction permanently, so blocks, options
  and preset names added later stopped reaching the model with nothing to say so.
  Settings → Templates now names what is missing, and leaves a deliberate
  customisation alone.
- **A fractal card no longer redraws its whole orbit when resized.** Maximising
  and restoring an attractor recomputed up to 200,000 points on the main thread
  each time.
- **An attractor accepts no integration step it cannot use.** The largest `dt`
  the app allowed produced no orbit at all for several systems, and the card then
  reported that the coefficients had diverged.
- **Asking for a Hilbert curve, a Peano curve or a Lorenz attractor produced an
  error box.** Each is exactly what the ` ```fractal ` lane is for, but only seven
  presets had names, so anything else had to be written out as a raw L-system or
  IFS to render at all.
- **A fractal card kept its dark background after switching to the light theme.**
  The lane paints its own background into the canvas, so a card already on screen
  stayed dark until something resized it.
- **An attractor given coefficients that make it blow up drew an empty card.** The
  runaway values were kept and stretched the drawing area so far that the real
  orbit collapsed to a single pixel. The card now draws the part that stayed
  bounded, or says the system diverged.
- **An IFS map given a probability of `0` was still drawn.** A zero weight was read
  as "no weight given" and the map received an equal share of the points; a
  negative weight suppressed every map but the first.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- **Asking to visualise something is no longer excluded from the cache.** The same
  request twice cost two model calls, and because nothing was stored, a later plain-text
  rewording of it could not match either. Those turns are cached now and matched on the
  question itself rather than on similarity — two different drawing requests measure
  closer together than any usable threshold, so *"plot f(x) = sin(x)"* must never be
  served *"sin(2x)"*.
- **Ordinary questions were being excluded from the semantic cache.** A question was
  treated as a request for a chart whenever it mentioned one, so "what is graph theory",
  "explain knowledge graphs in Redis" and "how do I read a flame graph" were never looked
  up and never stored, each paying again for an answer already produced. Asking to *see*
  something is now distinguished from mentioning a picture; requests with no verb ("Sugar
  molecule in 2d and 3d") and follow-ups ("same thing but as a pie chart") are recognised,
  and idioms that borrow a drawing verb ("draw up a plan") are not.
- **An answer now says whether it came from the cache, and if not, why.** Previously a
  finished answer carried no cache badge at all, so a question that is never cacheable
  looked identical to one that simply had no match.
- **Cache settings take effect without a restart.** The similarity threshold and TTL were
  read once when the cache was first built, so changing them in Settings did nothing —
  and because the threshold is applied inside the vector search, lowering it could not
  widen what matched.
- **Changing the embedding model now clears the semantic cache** and resets its
  similarity threshold. The stored vectors come from the previous model and are not
  comparable, and neither is the threshold: two unrelated questions score about 0.10
  apart under `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and about 0.80 apart under `multilingual-e5-base`, so a
  setting carried across the change admits questions that were never asked.

### Changed
- **The cache similarity threshold now follows the embedding model** unless you set it
  yourself. Each model's value is the lowest that admitted no unrelated question in the
  set at `tests/fixtures/cache_calibration.py`; see **Semantic Cache** in `DOCS.md` for
  the table and for what no threshold can separate.
- **Regenerating an answer no longer fragments the cache**, and selecting a template no
  longer resets itself when settings are saved.
- **A corpus that retrieves nothing no longer counts as a score of 0.00.** One empty
  instance dragged every derived threshold to zero, which accepts every chunk.
- **The presets now require the same evidence the verdicts do.** They would derive a
  threshold from as few as three searches while the panel above them said there was not
  enough data to read the distribution.
- **`Avg Best Raw` in Analytics counted searches that retrieved nothing as a score of
  zero**, understating it by the share of empty searches — the figure the documentation
  points at for diagnosing a threshold that is too strict.
- **A setting with nothing measured behind it is no longer given a colour or a suggested
  value.** Reranking and hybrid search were graded from the configuration alone, so a
  deployment that had answered no questions still showed two amber verdicts with
  one-click apply buttons, and they survived resetting the counters.
- **Deleting a template no longer switches the chat to a different one.** The selection
  was held by list position, so removing an earlier template silently moved it.
- `Settings → Analytics` said retrieval statistics were reset on restart; they persist.
  The reset dialog now names everything it clears.

### Added
- **The RAG advice speaks per corpus.** Each corpus states the threshold it needs, and
  the panel reports the value every corpus can meet rather than an average — when two
  disagree, that disagreement is the finding, with both named. The ⓘ lists every corpus,
  what it clears today and what it needs.
- **The score distribution is drawn under the threshold slider**, with a marker that
  follows the slider and a live reading of what that value keeps.
- **Copy diagnosis** puts every measurement behind the verdicts on the clipboard as text.
- **Scores are kept separately per retrieval mode.** Question-mode and HyDE-mode searches
  score differently, and pooling them produced a threshold that suited neither; switching
  modes back restores the earlier history rather than discarding it.
- **The panel says how much traffic its numbers cover** when questions were answered from
  cache, since those run no retrieval and are absent from every figure.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-08-22

### Added
- **The RAG settings now advise you from your own retrieval history.** Each control
  carries a verdict drawn from what this deployment has measured — the scores retrieval
  produced and which chunks answers cited — with a one-click button to apply the
  suggested value. A setting with no measurement behind it says so and shows no colour.
- **Three presets — Precision, Recall and Economy.** Each resolves its similarity
  threshold from your own observed scores; with no history yet, the threshold is left
  unchanged and the preset says why. Applying one lists what it will change and stages
  it for review rather than saving.
- **An ⓘ on every RAG control**, explaining what it does and what raising or lowering it
  costs.
- **Reranking has a UI.** *Rerank retrieved chunks*, *Candidates to score* and *Chunks
  to keep*, under **Settings → RAG**; previously `config.json` only.
- **`GET /api/rag/advice`** returns the same verdicts and presets.

### Fixed
- Retrieval statistics survive a restart. They were held in memory only, so they emptied
  exactly when Settings was most likely to be opened.
- Deleting a RAG instance now removes its retrieval statistics with it.

## [1.8.6] — 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- **The in-app keyboard shortcut list advertised a shortcut that does nothing.** It
  offered `⌘/Ctrl+F` for search; that combination was given back to the browser's own
  find in 1.8.0 and the app's search moved to `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+F`. The list was never
  updated, so for two releases the only place in the app that says what the shortcuts
  are was wrong about the one that had changed.
- **`Enter` and `Shift+Enter` were missing from that list** — the two most-used keys in
  the app. It now matches the table in `DOCS.md` row for row, and names `⌘/Ctrl+F` as
  the browser's own so it is clear the app does not take it.
- **`DOCS.md` was missing `⌘/Ctrl+Enter`**, which sends a message.

## [1.8.5] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- **One model picker in the top bar.** Provider and model are chosen together from a
  single control reading `● Ollama / gemma4:31b-mlx`. It lists every model grouped by
  provider with a status dot on each group — green when the provider is reachable, red
  when it is configured but failing — and filters as you type. Providers with no API key
  are collapsed into one row that links to *Settings → Providers*. A provider offering
  more than eight models shows the model in use, `-latest` aliases and stable names
  first, with pinned dated snapshots behind a *Show all N* row. Replaces the seven
  provider buttons and the separate model dropdown.
- **Provider, model and knowledge-base scope are remembered per browser** and restored
  on reload.
- **The top bar is a single row.** It was two, and the second wrapped again as the
  session title and the token count grew — 99px on a fresh conversation, up to 198px in
  use, all of it taken from the chat. It is now a constant 52px at every width, and the
  controls give way in order of value as the window narrows rather than wrapping.
- **Clear chat moved to the sidebar**, beside the other actions that act on the current
  conversation.
- **The provider's default model is marked in the picker** — the free-tier model on
  Gemini and Mistral — in its own colour, with a `default` badge, and sorted directly
  below the model in use so it is never hidden behind *Show all N*.

### Removed
- **The estimated cost figure, everywhere it appeared** — the top-bar cost pill, the
  *Cost* column and partial-total warning in Analytics → Token Usage, the *Cost USD*
  column in the Analytics CSV, and the `pricing` block in `config.json`. The rates
  behind it were shipped constants that no provider supplied and nothing revalidated;
  prices change without notice, so the amount shown could go stale silently while still
  reading as an authority. Token counts are unaffected and remain the provider's own
  reported figures — price them against your provider's billing page.

  An existing `pricing` block in your `config.json` is now ignored. It is left in place
  rather than deleted, so nothing is lost if you kept notes there.

### Fixed
- **Image attachment did not work on any hosted provider.** The 📎 button and the 👁
  Vision badge were decided by looking the selected model up in a list only Ollama ever
  filled, and keyed on a display name while being called with a model id — so attaching
  an image was impossible on Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Groq and Qwen whatever the
  model supported, and pasting one reported *"Switch to a vision model to use images"*
  on a vision model. Hosted model lists now carry a vision flag, taken from the
  provider's own capability report where there is one. Present since 1.0.0.
- **Every page load reset the knowledge-base scope to "All RAGs".** The scope was fixed
  to all-instances at start-up and nothing restored the choice, so a reload silently
  changed what grounded your answers and overrode the instance the configuration
  stored. Present since 1.4.0.
- **Models that cannot hold a conversation were offered as chat models.** Gemini's list
  was filtered on the model id alone, so 37 entries reached the picker of which 21 could
  not answer a question — embedding, text-to-speech, image, robotics, computer-use and
  live-audio models among them. Mistral's list was not filtered at all despite claiming
  to be, adding embedding, OCR, moderation and audio models. Both now use the capability
  each API reports.
- **Switching provider announced success before it knew.** *"Provider: Claude API"*
  appeared the moment the button was pressed, while the model list was still loading and
  might come back empty; nothing said so afterwards, and the top bar showed the new
  provider beside the previous provider's model. The confirmation now names the model
  that was selected, or says the provider has none.
- **Send looked ready with no model selected.** The button stayed lit and the problem
  only surfaced after pressing it.
- **"Refresh Models" in a provider card replaced the active provider's model list**
  with that provider's, leaving the top bar offering models the running provider cannot
  use.
- **Opening *Settings → Ollama* while a hosted provider was active** replaced the active
  model list with Ollama's, silently disabling image attachment until the provider was
  switched.
- **The model list rendered underneath answer cards and tables.** The top bar applies a
  backdrop blur, which confines anything inside it to its own stacking layer, so the open
  menu was painted over by the conversation behind it.
- **A function plot failed whenever a definition's argument was not literally `x`.**
  A log-log relation is written `log(N) = -1.585 * log(x)`, and only `name(x) = …` was
  recognised as a definition — so the whole line was taken as the expression, read as
  *defining* a function called `log`, and every sample came back as a function rather
  than a number. The card reported `Plot error: no finite values`. Any argument name now
  works, and the legend keeps what you wrote. An expression that evaluates to something
  other than a number — writing `sin` where `sin(x)` was meant — now says so and names
  the type, instead of the same generic message.
- **Grouped citation markers were not clickable.** A model citing two passages writes
  `[3, 4]` as readily as `[3] [4]`, and only the lone form was linked — so the grouped
  one read as a citation but opened nothing.
- **The Mistral model list showed bare ids.** Fetched live it dropped the readable
  labels — including the *(free tier)* marks — that the built-in list carries.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **The Documents list failed on Redis Stack.** Listing an instance's documents asked
  the search engine for up to a million rows at once, which a stock Redis Stack refuses
  outright rather than truncating (`MAXAGGREGATERESULTS`, 10000 by default) — so
  *Settings → RAG → Documents* returned an error on that deployment, and the source
  list silently fell back to scanning the whole keyspace on every call. Both now read
  through a cursor and return every document however many there are. Present since
  1.5.1.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Token usage in Analytics.** A new *Token Usage* card shows all-time token
  consumption across every conversation, broken down by provider and model, with
  fresh input, prompt-cache reads, cache writes and output as separate columns and
  an estimated cost per model. Rows are ordered by cost, and when a model has no
  entry in the `pricing` table the card names it and says the total is partial. A
  *Reset tally* action clears the counters; conversations and their per-turn counts
  are untouched. Token and cost figures are now included in the Analytics CSV export.
- **Keep an answer.** **💾** on any answer indexes it into a knowledge base, so it outlives
  the semantic cache (one hour by default) and the conversation (one day) — and stays
  *retrievable*, not just readable. A review dialog offers the question, the answer and the
  sources it cited for editing first. Saved answers go to their own `saved-answers`
  instance, created on first use, so they can be switched off when an answer has to be
  grounded only in real documents; each one is a document named `answer://<date> <title>`
  that can be deleted on its own.
- **Scheduled re-crawl, in the interface.** *Settings → Web Sources → Scheduled Re-crawl*
  lists every URL on the timer with its instance, depth and last run, and can schedule the
  current URL, remove one, or re-crawl everything now. The on/off switch and the interval
  are saved with the rest of your settings.
- **File ingestion can be watched and stopped.** An ingest now has a Cancel button, and
  reopening the RAG tab re-attaches to one already running instead of showing an idle
  panel. Cancelling stops before the next file; everything already indexed is kept. On a
  first run the panel says the embedding model is being downloaded rather than sitting at
  an unmoving bar for several minutes.
- **Crawl progress shows real numbers.** With a page limit set the bar fills towards it;
  without one — the default — it shows pages indexed against pages discovered so far, with
  the queue depth beside it, and says which total it is counting against.
- **Citations are clickable.** The `[2]` markers in an answer now open the matching source
  in the sources panel and highlight it.
- **Messages are reviewable.** Errors stay on screen until dismissed instead of vanishing
  after three seconds, every message can be dismissed by hand, hovering pauses the
  countdown, and *Settings → Logs* keeps the session's messages so an error can be read
  after the fact.
- **Search covers more.** It searches retrieved source text as well as messages, can search
  every conversation rather than only the current one, reports how many matches it found
  and highlights each one in context.
- **A first run leads somewhere.** With no model available the welcome screen offers a route
  into provider settings instead of suggestion prompts that cannot work, and the three
  "select a model first" refusals now offer the same route.
- **Unsaved settings are no longer lost silently.** The panel marks itself as having unsaved
  changes and asks before discarding them on Escape, Cancel or a click outside. Sections
  that apply immediately — RAG instances and Redis endpoints — say so.

### Fixed
- Diagram labels containing brackets, parentheses, quotes or `<` no longer blank the
  diagram. Every flowchart node shape is now handled — rectangle, round, stadium,
  subroutine, cylinder, circle, double circle, asymmetric, rhombus, hexagon,
  parallelogram and trapezoid — as well as edge labels written as `-->|text|`, each
  keeping its own shape. A `<` renders as a real `<` in edge labels and subgraph titles.
- A valid diagram using a quoted compound shape, such as `A[("Redis (db)")]` or
  `A[["Sub (x)"]]`, was corrupted into an unrenderable one.
- A node label containing `|`, such as `A[Ratio|Score]`, was corrupted, and could also
  swallow the label of the edge that followed it.
- Diagrams are no longer inserted when the HTML sanitiser is unavailable, matching every
  other rendering lane.
- Cache-creation tokens were missing from the all-time tally, under-reporting cumulative
  cost for prompt-cached conversations.
- A provider error unrelated to token reporting — a mistyped model name, an over-long
  conversation — switched token counting off for that provider until restart.
- API keys are no longer sent in a URL when testing a provider connection, keeping them
  out of server and proxy access logs and out of browser history.
- A Redis endpoint whose name contained quotes or semicolons could run arbitrary script in
  the page when the endpoint list was displayed.
- Deleting or resetting a RAG instance whose name contained `*`, `?` or `[` could affect
  other instances on the same Redis endpoint. Instance names are now validated wherever an
  instance can be created, and the pattern is escaped everywhere it is used.
- Images could be served from a directory whose name merely started with an allowed one.
- Importing a RAG instance stored its chunks outside the search index, so an imported
  instance held all its data and returned nothing from any search. An instance exported
  under a different embedding model now has the affected chunks re-embedded rather than
  stored as vectors the index cannot use.
- Exporting a RAG instance omitted the embeddings of the final partial batch.
- *Export & Delete* waited a fixed moment rather than for the export, so a large instance
  could be deleted before its backup finished. It now waits, keeps the instance if the
  export fails, and asks you to confirm the file actually downloaded — a cancelled save
  cannot be detected by the browser.
- Regenerating an answer could delete the whole conversation when the request carried a
  malformed position.
- Cancelling a crawl left a background worker running for the lifetime of the process and
  discarded the record of pages already indexed.
- Pausing or cancelling a crawl whose address contained a `#` fragment reported success
  while the crawl continued at full speed.
- A tool result containing an image also dumped the raw tool call, including the entire
  image data, below the picture.
- Importing a configuration now asks for confirmation first and reports the actual
  outcome; a failed import previously reported success while changing nothing.
- Exporting the configuration no longer navigates away from the app.
- "Reset Defaults" no longer discards saved web sources, watched folders and endpoints
  without saying so.
- Clearing a conversation, removing a web source, a prompt template or a Redis endpoint,
  and resetting the retrieval counters now ask for confirmation first and say exactly what
  is lost.
- Switching to Claude without a key no longer leaves the model list showing another
  provider's models.
- An ingestion that partly failed is now reported as a warning rather than as neutral
  information.
- Saved web-source URLs and ingestion-log instance names are escaped when displayed.
- Dismissing a "Remove document?" dialog no longer raises a console error.
- Pause and Cancel during a crawl acted on whatever was typed in the URL box rather than
  on the running crawl, so editing that field — which is also where the next crawl is
  composed — left the crawl running while the buttons reported it stopped.
- Re-opening the panel during a crawl showed a fixed 50% that meant nothing, overwrote a
  URL you were part-way through typing, showed a paused crawl as running, and could only
  ever attach to the first of several crawls. It now shows measured progress, leaves the
  URL box alone, names the crawl it is following and offers the others.
- Scheduling a re-crawl before the instance list had loaded stored it against an instance
  no crawl would ever write to.
- *System Status* reported four of the seven providers, so Qwen, Mistral, Groq and Gemini
  users found nothing about the provider they were running on. All seven are listed, an
  unconfigured one is offered a route to set it up, and the per-provider dots on the
  Providers tab — which no code had ever painted — now reflect what is reachable.
- A "⟳ Update dots" button that refreshed nothing has been removed.
- `⌘/Ctrl+F` no longer replaces the browser's own find. The in-app search moved to
  `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+F`.
- The sources panel numbered a chunk by its position on screen while the answer cited its
  position in the retrieved list, so on a reopened or cached conversation `[2]` and `#2`
  could refer to different sources.
- A Cancel button in one confirmation dialog rendered unstyled.
- A diagram node label written with spaces inside its shape, such as `A[ /In (raw)/ ]`,
  failed to render at all when it contained brackets or parentheses.
- A diagram node label with parentheses nested more than one level deep, such as
  `A(a (b (c)) d)`, failed to render.
- A diagram edge label written inline, such as `A -- say "hi" --> B`, failed to render when
  it contained a quote, and showed the literal text `&lt;` where a `<` was meant.
- A timeline containing a time of day failed to render entirely. Writing a timed event as
  `2024-01-01 00:00 : Sunrise` is the natural thing to do, and the colon inside `00:00` was
  read as the period separator; the error it produced pointed at the diagram's first line
  rather than at the colon. Times now render as written, in periods, section labels and
  accessibility lines alike.
- **Accessibility.** Text colours in the light theme now meet the WCAG AA contrast
  minimum, and so does the accent behind white text in both themes; the provider "not
  configured" dot, the selected-model hint, the table filter and the provider name used
  colours that were never defined and fell back to inherited text. Form controls have a
  visible focus outline — which now appears the instant focus lands rather than fading in
  over a quarter of a second — and a distinguishable border. Every field is linked to its
  label, and toggles and icon-only buttons have accessible names. Dialogs declare
  themselves as dialogs, move focus in on open and hand it back on close, keep Tab inside
  themselves,
  and close one layer at a time with Escape; the closed pinned panel is no longer
  reachable by keyboard. Status and error messages are announced, the document has a
  heading and landmarks, message actions are reachable by keyboard and visible on touch,
  and animations — including the streaming avatar — honour the system "reduce motion"
  setting.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Real token usage & cost.** Every provider's reported token counts are captured
  per turn, stored with the conversation, and tallied all-time (`GET /api/usage`).
  The top-bar pills show exact input/output/total when the provider reports them
  (the `~` estimate remains only for turns without counts), plus an estimated cost
  from the editable `pricing` table in config.json (approximate defaults for the
  common paid models; free-tier and local models show no cost).
- **Watched folders.** Point a RAG instance at local folders (Settings → Web
  Sources): new and changed supported files are ingested automatically on a
  configurable interval; an edited file replaces its previous version. Files
  deleted from disk stay indexed until removed via Documents.
- **Fork a conversation** (⑂ on any answer): a new session containing everything
  up to that point; the original is untouched.
- **Ollama model management** in Settings → Providers → Ollama: pull a model with
  live progress, and remove installed models.
- **Editable card source.** A rich card's Source view is now editable — Apply
  re-renders the card from the edited spec in place (local only; the stored
  conversation is unchanged); **↺ Reset** discards the edits and restores the
  original.
- **⟲ Reset zoom** on a Mandelbrot/Julia card after a click-to-zoom, returning
  to the spec's own view (mirrors the existing chart zoom-reset).
- **Pan & zoom in Maximize** for diagram cards (mermaid, dot, gantt, timeline,
  SVG): scroll to zoom at the cursor, drag to pan, double-click to reset.
- **Interactive geometry** (✋ on a geometry card): shows the construction's
  control points and lets you drag them; toggle off to return to the clean figure.
- The welcome screen shows the running build — version (linked to its release
  notes), license, and the AGPL source link — reported live by `/api/health`.
- **` ```fractal ` render lane** — Mandelbrot and Julia sets (click to zoom,
  shift-click to zoom out, smooth colouring, four palettes), IFS chaos-game
  attractors and L-system turtle graphics, all drawn on a plain canvas with no
  external library. Presets `fern`, `sierpinski`, `dragon`, `koch`, `plant`,
  `mandelbrot` and `julia` render from a one-line spec; custom affine maps and
  rewrite rules are data-only, with hard caps on iterations, points and
  expansion size.

### Fixed
- Grounded answers judge **relevance** first: retrieved context that does not bear
  on the question is ignored (with a one-line note) and the question is answered
  from general knowledge — a weak vocabulary-overlap match no longer produces an
  answer that summarises an unrelated document and abstains. Each context chunk
  now carries its match score so the model can calibrate.
- `stop.sh` also finds and stops a VisualWeaver instance started outside the
  scripts (no pidfile) but holding the app port; `start.sh` no longer announces
  the repo's version when a pre-existing instance kept the port — the banner now
  reports what is actually serving.
- `` ```fractal `` no longer fails to render when an IFS probability is written
  as a fraction (`1/3`) — valid maths, invalid JSON. It is now converted to its
  decimal value before parsing.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- The RAG selector has a **No RAG** option: the model answers from its own
  knowledge with no retrieval and no grounding instructions, distinct from
  querying one instance or all of them.
- Settings → Templates has an **"Include chart/diagram authoring rules"** toggle.
  Turn it off on text-only deployments to stop sending the ~2,000-token chart/plot/
  diagram/map/music authoring section to the model on every message.
- Settings → RAG has a **Chat History Budget** control that caps how much recent
  conversation is resent to the model each turn, and a note showing how Top-K and
  Chunk Size translate into tokens per grounded answer.
- The top-bar token estimate is split into **input** (your prompts), **output**
  (the model's replies) and **total**, each a colour-coded pill.

### Changed
- Retrieved context and uploaded-file text now ride on the question turn instead of
  the system prompt, so the system prefix stays stable across a conversation. This
  lets the provider cache it (billed input tokens re-read far cheaper on repeat
  turns for Claude and the OpenAI-compatible providers) — no behaviour change to
  answers. Responses (the app UI and JSON API) are now gzip-compressed.

### Fixed
- `` ```geometry `` blocks render many more constructions: rectangles, circles from
  a centre and radius, arcs and sectors from a centre/radius/angle, and dashed lines.
  An element the renderer cannot build is now skipped with a note at the foot of the
  card, instead of the whole figure failing to render.
- `` ```mermaid `` flowcharts no longer fail to render when a node or edge label
  contains parentheses, quotes, a `<`, or other special characters.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Each question you asked now carries its own action bar (on hover): **Copy** puts
  the query text on the clipboard, **Rerun** asks it again (a matching cached answer
  may be served), and **Force rerun** asks it again while bypassing the cache for a
  fresh answer.
- Function plots (` ```plot `) now list each function's definition —
  `name(x) = expression` — colour-matched to its curve, in a block in front of the
  graph. A legend of bare `f(x)`, `g(x)`, `h(x)` no longer hides what each function
  is. The domain line is not treated as a function.

### Fixed
- The JavaScript test helpers ran snippets via `node -e`, whose single-argument
  size limit on Linux (128 KB) failed the CI `tests` workflow on large snippets
  while passing on macOS; they now run the program from a temp file.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-07

Upgrading from an earlier version keeps working immediately; the search index
migrates itself on first start (v4 → v5, no data dropped). To benefit from the new
default embedding model, existing corpora must be re-ingested — until then they
keep working with the model they were built with.

### Added
- Four render lanes: `gantt`, `timeline`, `network` (force-directed, draggable) and
  `geojson` (Leaflet with per-feature popups).
- Every Markdown table an answer produces is now sortable (by value, including
  currency and dates), filterable, and exportable to CSV, with a sticky header.
- Charts support wheel-zoom (hold Ctrl) and drag-to-pan with a Reset button, and a
  Data button that reveals the underlying series as a sortable table.
- `abc` music scores have a Play button.
- Embedding models `intfloat/multilingual-e5-base` and `BAAI/bge-m3` are selectable
  in Settings, alongside the new default.
- Each chunk records which embedding model produced its vector, so an instance can
  hold vectors from more than one model.
- Crawls can be paused and resumed, not only cancelled.
- Backup and restore procedure documented in `DOCS.md`.
- A mutation-tested regression suite (`tests/mutation_sweep.py`,
  `tests/mutations.json`) that fails the build if a catalogued defect can be
  reintroduced without a test going red.

### Changed
- Default embedding model is now `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` (384-dimensional,
  512-token window). It covers 100+ languages; the previous default tokenised many
  non-Latin scripts as `[UNK]`. New installs only — existing installs keep their
  model until changed.
- Frontend libraries upgraded: `marked` 9 → 16, DOMPurify → 3.4.11, KaTeX → 0.17.0,
  `vis-network` → 10.1.0, and `viz.js` 2.1.2 → `@viz-js/viz` 3.29.0.
- HNSW search breadth (`EF_RUNTIME`) raised to 128, restoring full recall against
  exact search on the reference corpus.
- Container runs as a non-root user; the bundled Redis has a memory bound and an
  eviction policy.

### Fixed
- A `dot`/Graphviz graph using `style="rounded,filled"` rendered as solid black
  boxes with invisible labels.
- A sentence containing both currency and inline math (`Refund $20 if the error
  $e$ …`) typeset the prose as math and left the real math as plain text.
- Line, scatter and bubble charts could zoom to a zero-width range and become blank
  with no way to recover except reloading.
- The chart Data table was empty for scatter and bubble charts.
- Molecule structures were clipped by their card.
- The `geometry` lane's labels were unreadable in dark mode.
- `solve` with `expand:` returned the input unchanged instead of expanding it.
- Cached answers were missing from the saved transcript, breaking session restore,
  regenerate, the version switcher and feedback.
- The "no knowledge-base match" warning appeared on answers where retrieval never
  ran.
- The semantic cache could replay an answer produced with an instance switched off.
- Per-document delete was case-insensitive and did not release crawled URLs.
- `plot3d` titles were dropped under the upgraded Plotly.
- `abc` playback fetches its soundfont from a host the Content-Security-Policy now
  permits; the README's CSP description was corrected to match.
- `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` completed, including the FluidR3_GM soundfont
  (CC-BY-3.0) attribution and the corrected Graphviz (EPL-2.0) entry.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-02
- The `visualweaver` command-line entry point ignored its arguments; `--help` started
  a server and hung instead of printing help, and `--port`/`--host` were discarded.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-01
- Multilingual embedding default introduced, regression suite added, and a batch of
  retrieval, ingestion and UI defects fixed.
