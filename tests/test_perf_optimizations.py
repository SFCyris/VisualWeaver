These guard the invariants an adversarial QA pass found unprotected — above all
that the token-budgeted history window never hands a provider an assistant-first
message list (Anthropic and Gemini reject "first message must use the user role"),
which was a real regression the flat ``[-10:]`` window never had. Pure functions,
no Redis needed.
