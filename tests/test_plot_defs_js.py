"""The function plot lists every function's DEFINITION in front of the graph.

A legend that says only "f(x)", "g(x)", "h(x)" does not tell the reader what those
functions are. `_plotDefsHtml(spec)` builds a coloured block — one "name(x) = expr"
line per function — that `renderPlotBlocks` inserts immediately before the plot
card. This drives the REAL `_plotDefsHtml` under node (with the same `_plotEsc` and
`_plotNum` helpers it depends on) and asserts on the HTML it returns, so it fails if
the block stops listing the expressions, mis-colours them, or swallows the domain
line as if it were a function. Guarded by mutations.json entries shown to make it red.
