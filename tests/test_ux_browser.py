"""Workflow fixes, measured in a real browser.

The browser work lives in ``tests/ux_probe.py``; it runs once per session under whichever
interpreter has Playwright, so the suite still runs on a bare checkout — it skips instead.
Same design as ``test_a11y_browser.py``.

Every assertion is on an observed value: the pixel width the progress bar actually paints,
the JSON body a Cancel button actually posted, whether a toast is still in the DOM four
seconds later. None of these defects were visible to a grep — the old progress bar carried
a literal ``50%``, and Pause read a text field that had nothing to do with the crawl.
