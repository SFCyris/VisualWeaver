"""The mermaid flowchart label-escaping transform, run as real JavaScript.

Models put (), ", %, and other specials inside an UNQUOTED flowchart node label —
``E[Brain "draws" a line]`` or ``D[Light bends (down)]`` — which mermaid's parser
rejects, blanking the whole diagram. ``_mermaidSafeLabels`` wraps each rectangle
label's content in quotes (making the specials safe) and folds inner ASCII quotes into
curly ones so they can't close the wrapper, leaving other diagram types, already-quoted
labels, and compound shapes alone.

Extracted from ``index.html`` and run under node — pure string work, no browser. The
actual mermaid parse/render of the transformed source is exercised manually (and the
transform is deterministic, so the string output fully characterises it).
