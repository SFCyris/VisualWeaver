"""Chart zoom and the chart data table, measured in a real browser.

Everything here is driven through real input — a ``WheelEvent`` with ``ctrlKey``
from ``mouse.wheel``, a press-move-release drag, and ordinary clicks with
Playwright's actionability checks left ON — and asserted on measured layout:
axis ranges read off ``chart.scales``, ``offsetHeight`` off the reset button,
painted pixels off the canvas.

That is the point. The two defects these tests cover both passed a suite of
source-level assertions:

  * **A1.** ``limits:{x:{minRange:1e-9}}`` reads like a limit and is not one. On a
    category axis the zoom plugin steps by whole label indices, so five labels
    collapsed from ``[0,4]`` to ``[2,2]`` — zero width — in two wheel notches.
    The "⟲ Reset zoom" button that would have undone it is created with
    ``style="display:none"`` and no ``onZoom``/``onPan`` callback ever unhid it:
    measured ``offsetHeight: 0`` in every state, and a real click timed out. The
    chart was unrecoverable short of reloading the page.
  * **A2.** the data table was built from ``data.labels``, which scatter and
    bubble do not have. Measured ``rows: []`` — an empty table for exactly the
    chart types that get zoom.

The browser work lives in ``tests/browser_probe.py``; it runs once per session
under whichever interpreter has Playwright (the project venv does not), so the
suite still runs on a bare checkout — it skips instead.
