"""The grounded-context prompt must gate on RELEVANCE, not just instruct citation.

The old wording ("Answer using the numbered context below … say so rather than
filling the gap from general knowledge") had no relevance-judgement step, so a
weak vocabulary-overlap match (a real case: "Beginning of Old MacDonald" pulled a
43% Linux man-page chunk) made the model summarise the irrelevant chunk and
abstain instead of answering. The prompt now tells the model the context is
machine-retrieved, to ignore irrelevant context without narrating it, and shows
each chunk's match score so it can calibrate."""
