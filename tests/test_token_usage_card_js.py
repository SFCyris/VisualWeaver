"""The Analytics "Token Usage" card, run as real JavaScript.

The card is the only surface that answers "how many tokens have I actually burned"
across every session. It reads GET /api/usage, whose fields are disjoint token
classes (fresh input / cache read / cache write / output), so the column semantics
are the thing worth pinning down.

The card reports tokens and nothing else. It used to estimate a dollar cost from a
table of hand-written rates that no provider supplied and nothing revalidated —
prices change without notice, so the figure was as likely to be wrong as right.

Extracted from index.html and run under node — pure string work, no browser.
