"""The suite's own cleanup, which had no coverage and therefore leaked for months.

Tests share db 0 with the user's real corpus — RediSearch refuses FT.CREATE on any
other db — so they namespace every key under a per-pid prefix and delete only that.
The delete matched the prefix only at the START of a name, and a test that builds a
RAG instance called ``<prefix>kept`` produces ``rag:<prefix>kept:chunk:1`` and an
index ``rag:<prefix>kept:idx``. Both begin with ``rag:``, so neither was matched:
every run left its instances, chunks and indexes behind in the live database.

These assert on real Redis state, because the defect was invisible to every other
kind of check — the suite was fully green while it accumulated 38 stray instances.
