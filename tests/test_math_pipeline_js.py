"""Math-pipeline regression tests that EXECUTE renderMarkdown, not grep it.

These guard the B1/B3 fix (internal/OPEN-ISSUES-1.5.0.md): math is now tokenised by
marked itself (the rrMath extension in setupMarked), instead of being pre-extracted
from the raw text with a global regex. The three defects this closed only manifest
once the *real* marked runs, so the suite loads the exact vendored build
(tests/fixtures/marked.umd.js, marked 16.3.0 — the same version index.html loads from
the CDN) and runs the real renderMarkdown under node.

DOMPurify is a pass-through stub: every one of these corruptions is already present in
the HTML *before* the sanitiser, so a stub is enough and keeps the test off jsdom.

Each behaviour below is paired with an entry in tests/mutations.json that reintroduces
the old defect and has been shown to make the matching test go red — a source-level
grep would not have caught any of them (the old buggy regex, the sentinel leak, and
the alt-attribute span injection all leave the identifiers in place).
