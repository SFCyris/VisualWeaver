"""B4 / B5 / B8 measured in a real browser (molecule clip, geometry dark-mode
contrast, abc reset duration).

The browser work lives in ``tests/visual_probe.py``; it runs once per session under
whichever interpreter has Playwright (the project venv does not), so the suite still
runs on a bare checkout — it skips instead. Same design as ``test_chart_browser.py``.

These assert on measured pixels and computed colour, never on source text:

  * **B4** ``scrollHeight <= clientHeight`` for the molecule card — nothing is cut off.
  * **B5** a WCAG contrast ratio computed from the label's ``getComputedStyle().fill``
    and the composited card background, ``>= 4.5:1`` in dark mode (and still ``>= 4.5``
    in a light render that follows a dark one, proving the global JXG.Options change
    does not leak).
  * **B8** the millisecond value the reset timer is scheduled from is ``> 0`` — it was
    ``0`` because ``getTotalTime()`` returned ``null``.

Each is paired with a tests/mutations.json entry shown to make the matching assertion
go red.
