"""Accessibility and destructive-action safety, measured in a real browser.

The browser work lives in ``tests/a11y_probe.py``; it runs once per session under
whichever interpreter has Playwright (the project venv does not), so the suite still
runs on a bare checkout — it skips instead. Same design as ``test_visual_lanes_browser.py``.

Every assertion here is on a COMPUTED value, never on source text. That is the point:
the defects being guarded were all invisible to a grep — a focus ring present in the CSS
but measuring 1.15:1, a dialog with `role` but no keyboard exit, an Escape handler that
closed the wrong layer, a confirm() that fired but named nothing.
