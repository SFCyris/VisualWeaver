# EMBEDDING MODEL REGISTRY
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# Every chunk records which model produced its vector, as the small integer id
# below. Ids are a permanent contract: never renumber or reuse one, because
# stored chunks reference them. Append new models with the next free id.
#
# The id is what makes a mixed-model instance possible later: a corpus can hold
# vectors from several models, and a query is then embedded once per model
# present and the result sets fused. Vectors of different widths cannot share
# one RediSearch vector field, so such an index needs one field per dimension —
# hence `field` below, which is already dimension-derived rather than fixed.
#
# E5 models require an asymmetric prefix: "query: " on the search text and
# "passage: " on the stored text. Omitting it does not error, it just quietly
# degrades retrieval, so the prefixes live here rather than at the call sites.
# ── cache_threshold ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The cosine similarity at which two questions are treated as the same question by the
# semantic cache. It is a property of the MODEL, not a preference: the models below do
# not share a scale. Measured on tests/fixtures/cache_calibration.py, two unrelated
# questions score 0.10 apart under all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and 0.80 apart under
# multilingual-e5-base — so one number cannot mean the same thing in both, and a value
# carried across a model change is not the setting the user thought they had.
#
# Chosen as the lowest threshold that produced ZERO false hits on that set, because the
# two errors do not cost the same: a false hit serves the user a cached answer to a
# DIFFERENT question, while a miss costs one model call. Precision first.
#
# What sets the floor in every model is negation and entity swaps — "enable TLS" against
# "disable TLS", "capital of France" against "capital of Germany" — which score above
# most genuine paraphrases. No threshold separates those, so the values below buy safety
# by giving up recall, and the residual risk is documented in DOCS.md.
#
# Measured through the SAME pipeline the cache uses — cache._normalize_query first, then
# the query prefix — because both change the text before it is embedded. Measuring the
# raw sentence instead put three of these a full step too low, and at that value a live
# lookup for "how do I disable TLS on redis" was served the answer to "how do I ENABLE
# TLS on redis" at 0.9713: casefolding turns TLS into tls and takes the acronym with it.
