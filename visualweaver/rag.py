    Search a RAG instance and return the top-K most relevant chunks.

    When ``hybrid=True`` (default) the search combines two strategies via
    Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):

      1. **Vector KNN** — semantic similarity via redisvl VectorQuery (HNSW cosine).
         Catches paraphrases and related concepts.
      2. **BM25 full-text** (``SCORER BM25STD``) — exact/near-exact keyword
         matching. Catches precise terms a paraphrase-tuned embedding misses.

    RRF formula: each result gets 1/(K+rank) for every list it appears in.
    K=60 is the standard constant that prevents high ranks from dominating.
    Results are then re-ranked by combined RRF score. A chunk that matched the
    full-text leg is kept regardless of the cosine ``threshold`` (it was
    selected lexically, so the cosine bar is the wrong gate); only vector-only
    hits are threshold-filtered.

    ``source_filter`` (substring of a chunk's source) is pushed INTO both legs
    as a TAG pre-filter — ``(@source:{*frag*})`` — so the KNN and BM25 searches
    run within the matching sources. This replaces an earlier post-filter that
    ran after the top-K cut and silently returned nothing when the scoped source
    lost the global ranking race.
