    Parallel BFS web crawler with optional JavaScript rendering.

    ``stats``, when given, is a caller-owned dict this crawl keeps up to date in place
    with ``discovered`` (URLs the frontier has ever admitted) and ``queued`` (URLs still
    waiting). A BFS over an unknown site has no total to count towards, so pages-done
    against pages-discovered is the only honest progress ratio available — the UI shows
    an indeterminate bar without it whenever max_pages is 0, which is the default.

    Architecture
    ------------
    • BFS queue (asyncio.Queue) drives link discovery — breadth-first so
      shallow pages are indexed first and progress is visible immediately.
    • asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency) limits how many pages are in-flight at
      once without spawning an unbounded number of tasks.
    • A single shared httpx.AsyncClient is reused across all requests in the
      crawl for connection keep-alive and HTTP/2 multiplexing (fast path).
    • With js_render=True (requires crawl4ai + playwright) a single browser
      context is opened once and reused across all workers — far cheaper than
      launching a new browser tab per page.

    Speed improvement vs old sequential recursive crawler
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Old: each page was fetch→extract→embed→store before the next URL was even
         requested.  100 pages × 250 ms avg latency = ~25 s minimum wall time.
    New: up to `concurrency` (default 10) pages fetched concurrently.
         100 pages ÷ 10 workers × 250 ms = ~2.5 s minimum (≈10× faster).
