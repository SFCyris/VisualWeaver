    Generate a short hypothetical document that would answer the query.

    HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) improves RAG retrieval by bridging
    the vocabulary gap between short queries and long documents:
      1. Ask the LLM to write a brief answer to the query.
      2. Embed the hypothetical answer (not the raw query).
      3. Use that embedding for KNN vector search.

    The hypothesis is never shown to the user — it is only used as the search
    vector.  The original query is still used for BM25 keyword search in hybrid mode.
